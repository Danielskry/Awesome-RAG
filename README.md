# üòé Awesome Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository contains a curated [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and general information on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications in Generative AI.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in Generative AI where additional context is retrieved from external sources to enrich the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allows LLMs to incorporate up-to-date, specific, or sensitive information that they may lack from their pre-training data alone.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Information on RAG
In traditional RAG approaches, a basic framework is employed to retrieve documents that enrich the context of an LLM prompt. For instance, when querying about materials for renovating a house, the LLM may possess general knowledge about renovation but lacks specific details about the particular house. Implementing an RAG architecture allows for quick searching and retrieval of relevant documents, such as blueprints, to offer more customized responses. This ensures that the LLM incorporates specific information to the renovation needs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its responses.

## üìä Metrics

### Search metrics

These metrics can be used to evaluate how effectively RAG systems match and integrate external documents or data sources. Alternatively, you may develop your own custom metrics for matching documents or data sources based on your specific domain or niche. Custom metrics can capture domain-specific nuances and improve the relevance and accuracy of your RAG system.

- [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)
  - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
  - Highly effective for comparing text embeddings where the direction of the vectors represents semantic information.
  - Commonly used in RAG systems to measure semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings.

- [Dot Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)
  - Calculates the sum of the products of corresponding entries of two sequences of numbers.
  - Equivalent to cosine similarity when vectors are normalized.
  - Simple and efficient, often used with hardware acceleration for large-scale computations.

- [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
  - Computes the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
  - Can be used with embeddings but may lose effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces due to the "curse of dimensionality."
  - Often used in clustering algorithms like K-means after dimensionality reduction.

- [Jaccard Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
  - Measures the similarity between two finite sets as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.
  - Useful when comparing sets of tokens, such as in bag-of-words models or n-gram comparisons.
  - Less applicable to continuous embeddings produced by LLMs.
 
**Note:** Cosine Similarity and Dot Product are generally seen as the most effective metrics for measuring similarity between high-dimensional embeddings. Euclidean Distance and Jaccard Similarity can be useful in certain contexts but have limitations due to high dimensionality and the nature of embeddings. Selecting the appropriate metric is crucial for optimizing the performance and accuracy of your RAG system.
