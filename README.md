# üòé Awesome Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository contains a curated [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and general information on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications in Generative AI.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in Generative AI where additional context is retrieved from external sources to enrich the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allows LLMs to incorporate up-to-date, specific, or sensitive information that they may lack from their pre-training data alone.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Information on RAG

In traditional RAG approaches, a basic framework is employed to retrieve documents that enrich the context of an LLM prompt. For instance, when querying about materials for renovating a house, the LLM may possess general knowledge about renovation but lacks specific details about the particular house. Implementing an RAG architecture allows for quick searching and retrieval of relevant documents, such as blueprints, to offer more customized responses. This ensures that the LLM incorporates specific information to the renovation needs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its responses.

**A typical RAG implementation follows these key steps:**

1. **Divide the knowledge base:** Break the document corpus into smaller, manageable chunks.
2. **Create embeddings:** Apply an embedding model to transform these text chunks into vector embeddings, capturing their semantic meaning.
3. **Store in a vector database:** Save the embeddings in a vector database, enabling fast retrieval based on semantic similarity.
4. **Handle user queries:** Convert the user's query into an embedding using the same model that was applied to the text chunks.
5. **Retrieve relevant data:** Search the vector database for embeddings that closely match the query‚Äôs embedding based on semantic similarity.
6. **Enhance the prompt:** Incorporate the most relevant text chunks into the LLM‚Äôs prompt to provide valuable context for generating a response.
7. **Generate a response:** The LLM leverages the augmented prompt to deliver a response that is accurate and tailored to the user‚Äôs query.

## üìä Metrics

### Search metrics

These metrics are used to measure the similarity between embeddings, which is crucial for evaluating how effectively RAG systems retrieve and integrate external documents or data sources. By selecting appropriate similarity metrics, you can optimize the performance and accuracy of your RAG system. Alternatively, you may develop custom metrics tailored to your specific domain or niche to capture domain-specific nuances and improve relevance.

- **[Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)**

  - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
  - Highly effective for comparing text embeddings where the direction of the vectors represents semantic information.
  - Commonly used in RAG systems to measure semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings.

- **[Dot Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)**

  - Calculates the sum of the products of corresponding entries of two sequences of numbers.
  - Equivalent to cosine similarity when vectors are normalized.
  - Simple and efficient, often used with hardware acceleration for large-scale computations.

- **[Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)**

  - Computes the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
  - Can be used with embeddings but may lose effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces due to the "[curse of dimensionality](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/99171/why-is-euclidean-distance-not-a-good-metric-in-high-dimensions)."
  - Often used in clustering algorithms like K-means after dimensionality reduction.

- **[Jaccard Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)**
  - Measures the similarity between two finite sets as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.
  - Useful when comparing sets of tokens, such as in bag-of-words models or n-gram comparisons.
  - Less applicable to continuous embeddings produced by LLMs.

> **Note:** Cosine Similarity and Dot Product are generally seen as the most effective metrics for measuring similarity between high-dimensional embeddings.

### Response Evaluation Metrics

Response evaluation in RAG solutions involves assessing the quality of language model outputs using diverse metrics. Here are structured approaches to evaluating these responses:

- **Automated Benchmarking**

  - **[BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU):** Evaluates the overlap of n-grams between machine-generated and reference outputs, providing insight into precision.
  - **[ROUGE](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)>):** Measures recall by comparing n-grams, skip-bigrams, or longest common subsequence with reference outputs.
  - **[METEOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEOR):** Focuses on exact matches, stemming, synonyms, and alignment for machine translation.

- **Human Evaluation**
  Involves human judges assessing responses for:

  - **Relevance:** Alignment with user queries.
  - **Fluency:** Grammatical and stylistic quality.
  - **Factual Accuracy:** Verifying claims against authoritative sources.
  - **Coherence:** Logical consistency within responses.

- **Model Evaluation**
  Leverages pre-trained evaluators to benchmark outputs against diverse criteria:

  - **[TuringBench](https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/):** Offers comprehensive evaluations across language benchmarks.
  - **[Hugging Face Evaluate](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/index):** Calculates alignment with human preferences.

- **Key Dimensions for Evaluation**
  - **Groundedness:** Assesses if responses are based entirely on provided context. Low groundedness may indicate reliance on hallucinated or irrelevant information.
  - **Completeness:** Measures if the response answers all aspects of a query.
  - **Approaches:** AI-assisted retrieval scoring and prompt-based intent verification.
  - **Utilization:** Evaluates the extent to which retrieved data contributes to the response.
  - **Analysis:** Use LLMs to check the inclusion of retrieved chunks in responses.
